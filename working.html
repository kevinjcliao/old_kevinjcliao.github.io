    <h1>What I'm Working On</h1>
    <p class="about_text">
      I'm currently spearheading many initiatives to better student life on campus @Haverford College. These include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>HackTheTriCo: </b><p>An upcoming Hackathon at Haverford College designed to bring together students from the TriCo and beyond.</li>
      <li><b>The BiCo Fellowship: </b><p> A project I'm undertaking with a student at Bryn Mawr to form a summer internship fellows program that matches students with NGOs in the Philadelphia area. The aim is for students to be technical interns for the NGO for the summer with the mentorship and resources of Haverford/Bryn Mawr.</p></li>
      <li><b>WikiClub: </b><p>A Django project I'm working on to make it easier for students to register a club and start a club. Also makes it easier for students to see when clubs meet and have a formal register of all the clubs on campus.</p></li>
